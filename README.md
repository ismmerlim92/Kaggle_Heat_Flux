# Kaggle_Heat_Flux Competition
This is an imputation problem. You are to predict the missing values of the feature x_e_out [-] (with the corresponding row id). The file should contain a header and have the following format:  id,x_e_out [-] 4,0.00 7.0.12 10,-0.02 etc.

In addition to participating in the Kaggle_Heat_Flux competition to solve the imputation problem, we will create mathematical models of machine learning to predict the missing values of the feature x_e_out [-]. These models will use machine learning techniques to analyze the provided data and generate accurate predictions for the missing values. The goal is to develop effective models that can generalize and provide reliable solutions to this imputation challenge.
